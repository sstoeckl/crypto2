# Historical Cryptocurrency Prices for Active and Delisted Tokens!

This is a modification of the original `crypto` package by [jesse vent](https://github.com/JesseVent/crypto). It is entirely set up to use means from the `tidyverse` and provides `tibble`s with all data available via the web-api of [coinmarketcap.com](https://coinmarketcap.com/). **It does not require an API key but in turn only provides information that is also available through the website of [coinmarketcap.com](https://coinmarketcap.com/).**

It allows the user to retrieve

- `crypto_listings()` a list of all coins that were historically listed on CMC (main dataset to avoid delisting bias) according to the [CMC API documentation](https://coinmarketcap.com/api/documentation/v1/#operation/getV1CryptocurrencyListingsHistorical)
- `crypto_list()` a list of all coins that are listed as either being *active*, *delisted* or *untracked* according to the [CMC API documentation](https://coinmarketcap.com/api/documentation/v1/#operation/getV1CryptocurrencyMap)
- `crypto_info()` a list of all information available for all available coins according to the [CMC API documentation](https://coinmarketcap.com/api/documentation/v1/#operation/getV1CryptocurrencyInfo)
- `crypto_history()` the **most powerful** function of this package that allows to download the entire available history for all coins covered by CMC according to the [CMC API documentation](https://coinmarketcap.com/api/documentation/v1/#operation/getV1CryptocurrencyOhlcvHistorical)
- `crypto_global_quotes()` a dataset of historical global crypto currency market metrics to the [CMC API documentation](https://coinmarketcap.com/api/documentation/v1/#operation/getV1GlobalmetricsQuotesHistorical)
- `fiat_list()` a mapping of all fiat currencies (plus precious metals) available via the [CMC WEB API](https://coinmarketcap.com/api/documentation/v1/#operation/getV1FiatMap)
- `exchange_list()` a list of all exchanges available as either being *active*, *delisted* or *untracked* according to the [CMC API documentation](https://coinmarketcap.com/api/documentation/v1/#operation/getV1ExchangeMap)
- `exchange_info()` a list of all information available for all given exchanges according to the [CMC API documentation](https://coinmarketcap.com/api/documentation/v1/#operation/getV1ExchangeInfo)

# Update

Since version 1.4.5 I have added a new function `crypto_global_quotes()` which retrieves global aggregate market statistics for CMC. There also were some bugs fixed.

Since version 1.4.4 a new function `crypto_listings()` was introduced that retrieves new/latest/historical listings and listing information at CMC. Additionally some aspects of the other functions have been reworked. We noticed that `finalWait = TRUE` does not seem to be necessary at the moment, as well as `sleep` can be set to '0' seconds. If you experience strange behavior this might be due to the the api sending back strange (old) results. In this case let `sleep = 60` (the default) and `finalWait = TRUE` (the default).

Since version 1.4.0 the package has been reworked to retrieve as many assets as possible with one api call, as there is a new "feature" introduced by CMC to send back the initially requested data for each api call within 60 seconds. So one needs to wait 60s before calling the api again. Additionally, since version v1.4.3 the package allows for a data `interval` larger than daily (e.g. '2d' or '7d'/'weekly')

## Installation

You can install `crypto2` from CRAN with 
```{r cran-installation, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("crypto2")
```
or directly from github with:
```{r gh-installation, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("sstoeckl/crypto2")
```

## Package Contribution

The package provides API free and efficient access to all information from <https://coinmarketcap.com> that is also available through their website. It uses a variety of modification and web-scraping tools from the `tidyverse` (especially `purrr`).

As this provides access not only to **active** coins but also to those that have now been **delisted** and also those that are categorized as **untracked**, including historical pricing information, this package provides a valid basis for any **Asset Pricing Studies** based on crypto currencies that require **survivorship-bias-free** information. In addition to that, the package maintainer is currently working on also providing **delisting returns** (similarly to CRSP for stocks) to also eliminate the **delisting bias**.

## Package Usage

First we load the `crypto2`-package and download the set of active coins from <https://coinmarketcap.com> (additionally one could load delisted coins with `only_Active=FALSE` as well as untracked coins with `add_untracked=TRUE`).

```{r example}
library(crypto2)
library(dplyr)

# List all active coins
coins <- crypto_list(only_active=TRUE)
```

Next we download information on the first three coins from that list.

```{r example-info}
# retrieve information for all (the first 3) of those coins
coin_info <- crypto_info(coins, limit=3, finalWait=FALSE)

# and give the first two lines of information per coin
coin_info
```

In a next step we show the logos of the three coins as provided by <https://coinmarketcap.com>.

```{r logos, echo=FALSE, fig.show='hold', fig.align='center', out.width = '5%',out.height='5%'}
coin_info$logo %>% knitr::include_graphics(.)
```

In addition we show tags provided by <https://coinmarketcap.com>.

```{r tags}
coin_info %>% select(slug,tags) %>% tidyr::unnest(tags) %>% group_by(slug) %>% slice(1,n())
```

Additionally: Here are some urls pertaining to these coins as provided by <https://coinmarketcap.com>.

```{r urls}
coin_info %>% select(slug,urls) %>% tidyr::unnest(urls) %>% filter(name %in% c("reddit","twitter"))
```

In a next step we download time series data for these coins.

```{r history}
# retrieve historical data for all (the first 3) of them
coin_hist <- crypto_history(coins, limit=3, start_date="20210101", end_date="20210105", finalWait=FALSE)

# and give the first two times of information per coin
coin_hist %>% group_by(slug) %>% slice(1:2)
```

Similarly, we could download the same data on a monthly basis.

```{r historym}
# retrieve historical data for all (the first 3) of them
coin_hist_m <- crypto_history(coins, limit=3, start_date="20210101", end_date="20210501", interval ="monthly", finalWait=FALSE)

# and give the first two times of information per coin
coin_hist_m %>% group_by(slug) %>% slice(1:2)
```

Alternatively, we could determine the price of these coins in other currencies. A list of such currencies is available as `fiat_list()`

```{r fiat}
fiats <- fiat_list()
fiats
```

So we download the time series again depicting prices in terms of Bitcoin and Euro (note that multiple currencies can be given to `convert`, separated by ",").

```{r history2}
# retrieve historical data for all (the first 3) of them
coin_hist2 <- crypto_history(coins, convert="BTC,EUR", limit=3, start_date="20210101", end_date="20210105", finalWait=FALSE)

# and give the first two times of information per coin
coin_hist2 %>% group_by(slug,ref_cur) %>% slice(1:2)
```

As a new features in version 1.4.4. we introduced the possibility to download historical listings and listing information (add `quote = TRUE`).

```{r}
latest_listings <- crypto_listings(which="latest", limit=10, quote=TRUE, finalWait=FALSE)
latest_listings
```

An additional feature that was added in version 1.4.5 retrieves global aggregate market statistics for CMC.

```{r quotes}
all_quotes <- crypto_global_quotes(which="historical", quote=TRUE)
all_quotes
```
We can use those quotes to plot information on the aggregate market capitalization:

```{r quotes-plot}
all_quotes %>% select(timestamp, USD_total_market_cap, USD_altcoin_market_cap) %>% 
  tidyr::pivot_longer(cols = 2:3, names_to = "Market Cap", values_to = "bn. USD") %>% 
  tidyr::separate(`Market Cap`,into = c("Currency","Type","Market","Cap")) %>% 
  dplyr::mutate(`bn. USD`=`bn. USD`/1000000000) %>% 
  ggplot2::ggplot(ggplot2::aes(x=timestamp,y=`bn. USD`,color=Type)) + ggplot2::geom_line() +
  ggplot2::labs(title="Market capitalization in bn USD", subtitle="CoinMarketCap.com")

```


Last and least, one can get information on exchanges. For this download a list of active/inactive/untracked exchanges using `exchange_list()`:

```{r exchanges}
exchanges <- exchange_list(only_active=TRUE)
exchanges
```

and then download information on "binance" and "bittrex":

```{r exchange-info}
ex_info <- exchange_info(exchanges %>% filter(slug %in% c('binance','bittrex')), finalWait=FALSE)
ex_info
```

Then we can access information on the fee structure,

```{r fee}
ex_info %>% select(contains("fee"))
```

the amount of cryptocurrencies being traded (in USD)

```{r usd-vol}
ex_info %>% select(contains("spot"))
```
or the fiat currencies allowed:

```{r ex-fiat}
ex_info %>% select(slug,fiats) %>% tidyr::unnest(fiats)
```
